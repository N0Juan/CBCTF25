# MITRE - Network Security Challenge

## Challenge Information
- **Category:** Network Security  
- **Points:** TBD
- **Difficulty:** TBD

## Challenge Description
A network security challenge focused on MITRE ATT&CK framework analysis and threat hunting within captured network traffic.

## Challenge Files
- `mitre.pcap` - Network packet capture containing threat activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK

## Solution Overview
This challenge involves analyzing network traffic through the lens of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, requiring:
- Identification of attack techniques and tactics
- Mapping observed behaviors to MITRE ATT&CK TTPs
- Threat hunting and incident analysis
- Attack chain reconstruction

## MITRE ATT&CK Integration
The challenge likely focuses on:
- **Tactics**: High-level adversary objectives
- **Techniques**: Methods used to achieve tactical goals  
- **Procedures**: Specific implementations of techniques
- **Attack Pattern Mapping**: Correlating network evidence to known attack patterns

## Analysis Methodology
1. **Traffic Analysis**: Deep examination of network communications
2. **Behavioral Analysis**: Identifying suspicious network behaviors
3. **TTP Mapping**: Correlating findings to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
4. **Attack Reconstruction**: Building the complete attack timeline
5. **IOC Extraction**: Identifying indicators of compromise

## Key MITRE Categories to Consider
- Initial Access techniques
- Command and Control communications
- Data Exfiltration methods
- Lateral Movement patterns
- Persistence mechanisms

## Tools Used
- Wireshark for network analysis
- MITRE ATT&CK Navigator
- Threat hunting platforms
- Network forensics tools
- IOC extraction utilities

## Learning Objectives
- MITRE ATT&CK framework application
- Threat hunting methodologies
- Network-based attack detection
- Incident response techniques

## Flag Format
`CBCTF{...}`

## Notes
*Detailed solution pending - requires PCAP analysis with MITRE ATT&CK mapping*
